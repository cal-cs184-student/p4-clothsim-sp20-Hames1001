<h1 align="middle">Assignment 4: Cloth Simulation</h1>
    <h2 align="middle">James Razo</h2>

    <div class="padded">
        <p>One of the main aspects to computer graphics is to be able to display and observe some of the physical movements of
            an object. In this project I cover some of the physical components behind the simulations that occur in the real world.
            In this case my main object involved using a cloth to portray the actions involved when it falls onto a surface. This is made realistical by using springs and point masses to resolve the physical effects or to be able to handle collisions with itself and another object. 
        </p>

    <h2 align="middle">Part 1: Springs and Masses</h2>
        <p>This part consisted of creating a two dimensional grid with point mass and spring components. Ontop of creating the 
        springs from one point to another, I implemented some constraints that mimic some of the realistic movements of a cloth. 
        Such components involved were shearing, bending, and structural constraints. To add these constriants it involved
        scanning through the grid of masses that I created and considering all the possible point masses around the current index. To 
        determine a structural constraint I consider the point mass to the left and above from the current point mass. Shearing 
        constraints are considered to be diagonal upper left and upper right from the current point mass. Bending constraints are
        determined from two the left and two above from the current point mass. I check for out bounds with all these constraints to 
        confirm that I am dealing with point mass objects. Down below I portray a wirefram with no shearing constraint but all other
        constraints are enabled. This gives a wireframe of diagonals since we have removed the structural and bending. There is 
        image with only shearing constraint enabled and this removes the diagonal springs from the wireframe. The last image is of 
        constraints enabled.  </p>

    <h2 align="middle">Part 2: Simulation via Numerical Integration</h2>
        <p> This part involved the simulation of the cloth for some time delta t. My implementation involved iterating through the 
        point masses to calculation the external force on each point mass. Once I readjusted the actual force on each point, the next 
        step was to perform Hooke's law for any springs that were not a structural constraint. This involved iterating through the list
        of springs that I created in part one. Once the force of the springs and the point mass have been readjusted, these values were
        stored inside the point mass objects. In order to accurately capture the simulation of the cloth I used verlet integration to 
        determine the new position of each individual point mass for each time step. Below I display the equation used to compute the
        new position of the point mass.  </p>
         <br>
         <p>Here is the equation for Hooke's law. k_s is the spring constant, p_a and p_b are positions of two different point masses,
         and l is the springs rest length. </p>
        <p align="middle"><pre align="middle">F_s = k_s * (||p_a - p_b|| - l) </pre></p>
        <br>

        <p>Verlet Integration: Here t + dt is the new time step, t is the current time step, x is used as position, d is the damping
        term, velocity is determined by the current position minus the last position, and acceleration is a_t * delta squared.   </p>
        <p align="middle"><pre align="middle">x_(t + dt) = x_t + (1 - d)*(x_t - x_(t-dt)) + a_t * dt^2  </pre></p>
        <br>
        <p>Below are images of a cloth's simulation. We see the cloth at a rest state, all of the parameters are set to create a 
        smooth simulation of the cloth's midpoint dropping down. When I change the springs constant and leave every other parameter 
        unchanged, we see that at a low k_s there is an upward force after the cloth hits the lowest point when falling. You can see
        the tension on all four corners. However, with a high k_s we have a smoother simulation and no tension. With a low density 
        the same smooth effects are created but if we raise the density the cloth seems to be falling forever. With a lower damping
        parameter there is no ristriction on the cloth. Therefore, you see this irradical unrealistic behavior of the cloth bouncing 
        upwards after falling. This is different to a higher damping which produces the smooth effects but with no tension and no 
        bouncing effect which is also unrealistic.  </p>

    <h2 align="middle">Part 3: Handling Collisions with other Objects</h2>
        <p>In this part I adjusted the cloth's behavior to follow the real interactions between two objects. For the first part I had
            the cloth fall onto a sphere and computed the new position for the cloth. This was done by finding the tangent point 
            between a point mass position and the sphere's origin. Once that was found I corrected the position of the cloth by taking 
            into account the friction between the two objects. This part acquired the following results of a cloth ontop of a sphere and on the plane. We see that with a spring constant of 5000 there is a normal smooth behavior when the cloth comes in 
            contact with the sphere. However, at 500 the cloth seems to stretch further downwards into the sphere and with a spring 
            constant of 50000 the cloth looks stiff compared to the other two images.

    <h2 align="middle">Part 4: Handling Self-Collisions</h2>
        <p> To create the self collision between the cloth's point masses I had to iterate over all the possible combinations of 
            pairs of point masses to apply the correct forces acting on them. Therefore, I used a hash map and stored points depending 
            on their hashing values. In this case I decided that my hashing position was going to be the value of coordinates
            tP.y * tP.z + tP.x. Where tP.x, tP.y, tP.z is the position of the point mass modulated over the width, height, and 
            max(width, height) respectfully. With these positions stored I am able to accomadate for the forces between point masses 
            in linear time. All that was left to do was iterate through the point masses that shared the same hash position and check 
            if the distance between the current point mass and the candidate was a certain amount of distance within a given parameter.
            Down below are the results of the cloth colliding and folding with itself upon impact with the plane. When varying the 
            density and spring constant we see a change of behavior with the cloth's self-collision. With a lower k_s the cloth is a 
            lot more compacted then when we have a higher k_s the cloth wanders around the plane loosely. You can actually see that it 
            rolls on itself in the high k_s value side view. Upon changing the density we see that a low density produces similar 
            results to the cloth at rest image but with a higher density the cloth is compacted togetheras well.

    <h2 align="middle">Part 5: Shaders</h2>
        <p> This portion of the project combined the shader programs by using opengl. The shaders programs consists of a .frag and 
            .vert files which are used to piece together the final output color for a scene. In this case the .vert file reads all 
            vertices and writes a corresponding interpolated color by using barycentric coordinates. While the .frag file reads these 
            interpolated values and writes to every pixel a final color. For this part I created 5 different types of shaders. They were a diffuse shader, a Blinn-Phong shader, texture mapping, displacement and bump mapping, and finally a mirror shader. 
            The Blinn-phong shader displaced below is how it will look like if I only output the ambient, specular, and diffuse components individually. Combing these three effects together produces the Blinn-Phong effect by summing over the three 
            different vectors produced from each effect.

            To create the bump mapping effects I calculated for the normal vector displaced in model space to gain the bump effects. 
            This required that I use the texture passed in on the uv coordinates given to solve for dU and dV which were components of 
            the local space normal. To solve for dU, the texture space one ahead of coordinate u was needed to calculate the overall 
            texture for the point. Same was done for dV in terms of v. However, displacement mapping only required to use the current 
            position plus the normal passed in times the texture space of uv. Which gives a oddly shaped sphere in this case. Here are 
            the two different mappings. Furthermore, adjusting the sphere's mesh coarseness with -o 16 -a 16 and -o 128 -a 128 aquires 
            the following results.
